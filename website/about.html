                <h4>About Us</h4>
                <p>Our dogs love the oudoors where they can run, play, hike, swim and explore. The outdoors is their natural environment. One day chatting with friends on a hike with all our dogs we decided to start a non-profit service,<em> A City Dog's Getaway</em>. They foster dogs and we all wanted to find a way to financially support our local shelters. One weekend a month we take your dogs with ours for a weekend hike and fun activities. Next time you are going away for the weekend and can't take your best friend with you or you need a weekend to run errands and do chores without the guilt of not making it to the dog run or park
                consider <em>A City Dog's Getaway</em>. It will definitely be more fun for your dog than staying home with a sitter or spending time in a kennel.</p>
                <p>We donate 85% of our fee to help local shelters with the care, training, socialization, neutering and spaying of their dogs. So not only are you giving your dog a weekend getaway, you are also helping shelter dogs. Our volunteers are trustworthy, caring, responsible animal lovers. We have two volunteers who are dog trainers. They will meet and access your dog's socialization skills and their ability to listen to verbal cues or commands.</p>
                <p>We include at least one shelter dog to continue with their training and socialization. It's a fun and rewarding time for all. Check out our page of testimonials from some of our new best friend clients.</p>
